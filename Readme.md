# Consolidating - A series of small programming assignments

## This is a summative assessment!

<big>:boom: You are NOT, under ANY circumstances, to discuss this assignment with each other or ANYBODY other than me. At all. You may search the internet for inspiration or help, but I expect any code you write down to be entirely yours OR credited correctly. Any failure to abide by this will result in an academic honesty investigation. :boom:</big>

## Getting your Code

- [ ] Open Github Desktop
- [ ] Choose "File->Clone from Internet"
- [ ] Find this repository and clone it to your computer
- [ ] Open in VS Code by clicking the button.

## Setting up your server and build process

Before you look at the assignments, set up your server and build.

- [ ] Press Cmd-Shift-B or Ctrl-Shift-B to get the build window. Select `tsc:watch` from the list. This will make it so that your computer AUTOMATICALLY builds the typescript files whenver you save.
  * Just so you know, the javascript files get put in a special folder called `build`, just to keep them out of your way. If that folder doesn't appear, something bad is happening. 
- [ ] Click the "Go Live" button on the bottom to launch your live server.

As long as you did both of those steps, your test page will *always, automatically stay updated!* Every time you save one of the typescript files you will get a fresh, ready to test page.

Each time you close and open VS Code you'll need to start the build over. It may also die on its own sometimes if left alone - just restart if it doesn't seem to be updating.

## Doing your assignment
You have been assigned four required programming assignments. You can find the assignments in the folder called `problems`. The file names are `p1.ts`, `p2.ts`, `p3.ts`, and `p4.ts`, plus the OPTIONAL `p5.ts`.

The problems increase in difficulty (at least I think they do). Here are some guidelines for my CURRENT thinking on grading this (this is always subject to change as I more fully understand the descriptors and assignment):

* To earn an **Approaching Proficiency**, you will need to have made a solid attempt with at least partial success on all four required problems. Otherwise, the language of **Progressing**, **Emerging**, or **Insufficient** will likely apply.
* To earn a **Proficient**, all four assigned problems need to function as intended (with perhaps a few minor bugs on edge cases only). These problems are designed to test proficiency.
* To earn an **Accomplished** or **Exemplary**, you will need to show something *beyond proficiency*. SOME ways to potentially move beyond proficiency on this assignment might include:
  * Particularly elegant, well-documented, and/or well-organized solutions to the four required problems
  * Doing some good work on the optional problem 5 (but this doesn't mean you have to do the whole thing)
  * Tweaking the `styles.css` file to make the site have your own unique visual style
  
  These are not the only ways to demonstrate mastery on this assignment. I am intentionally NOT spelling out exactly what you need for an **Exemplary**, so don't ask!

## Committing and Pushing

You should **commit** and **push** your code regularly using VS Code or Github Desktop. I am hoping to see multiple commits from each of you! At the very least, it would be a good idea to commit and push each time you complete a new problem, since there are four.

### VS Code method

- [ ] Click the icon on the left that says "Source Control" when you hover over it.

- [ ] Then click the little "+" button next to any files you changed in that list. 
- [ ] Type a message summarizing the save, something like "completed problem 1" or "handing in" or "just saving" and click the check mark to commit. 
- [ ] Finally, click the three dots and choose "push" to upload your change. 
  
## Github Desktop method (possibly easier?)

- [ ] Open the assignment in Github Desktop
- [ ] Type "handing in" in the box labeled `Summary (Required)` and click the blue `Commit to Master` box.
- [ ] Click the `Push to Origin` box that appears in the upper right.
