/** ==== Problem 5 ====
 * 
 *  THIS PROBLEM SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE TOUCHED UNTIL ALL FOUR
 *  OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS ARE COMPLETE AND FUNCTIONAL. IT CANNOT REPLACXE
 *  THE OTHER PROBLEMS.
 * 
 * ---STEP 1: Edit the HTML---
 * Add a section at the end of index.html that should include three things:
 *  1) an appropriate header
 *  2) an input text box
 *  3) a button
 * (You are welcome to copy and paste from earlier parts of the HTML, but make
 * sure all ids are unique).
 * 
 * ---STEP 2: Edit main.ts---
 * The main.ts file imports all of the other files. It also 
 * sets up the buttons so that they call the correct functions.
 * 
 * Follow the two patterns in main.ts to make the button you just added call the `go()`
 * function from this file.
 * 
 * ---STEP 3: Make the function work---
 * When a user clicks the button in your problem 5 section, UP TO 4 things should happen:
 *  1) The title of the page (both the visible one and the one in the title bar) should
 *     change to be whatever the user had put in the input box. 
 *  2) The background color of the entire page body should change to a totally random
 *     color (you can use Google to find a randomColor() function to help)
 *  3) All of the OTHER problems should completely disappear.
 *     (hint - you can set the `style.display` value to "none" for any element to hide it.)
 *  4) A section should appear underneath the problem 5 area with an embedded video
 *     of your choice. (You can use the `.innerHTML` file of, say, a div to add random
 *     HTML like an embed code from YouTube). If you can figure out how to start playing
 *     it automatically, so much the better!
 * 
 *  You do not have to do all of these things - any parts are fine. If you have your own
 *  fun ideas for things to make happen in this section, feel free to do those instead!
 *  Just document your thinking.
